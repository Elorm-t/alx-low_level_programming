Task 0 - Positive anything is better than negative nothing: Program checks and outputs if a randomly generated number is positive, negative or zero.

Task 1 - The last digit: Program determines the last digit of a randomly generated number and outputs a message based on its value.

Task 2 - I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game: Program outputs lower-case letters of the alphabet using putchar() on a single line.

Task 3 - alphABET: Program outputs lower-case letters and upper-case letters of the alphabet using putchar() on a single line.

Task 4 - When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off: Program prints all lower-case letters except e and q, all on a line using putchar().

Task 5 - Numbers: Program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, on a line.

Task 6 - Numberz: Program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, on a line using putchar().
